n9 manifesto
===========================

n9 language intends to be "a better C". This claim has been made before, but probably not quite so literally.
If you think to yourself, "C would be a good language to write this project in, but man I hate writing C code",
then n9 would be a good candidate for your project. Otherwise, it probably is not for you.

The overriding guiding language precept is "C ABI compatibility". This precept makes several language design
decisions for us, and implies several pros and cons:
 - No garbage collection
 - No exceptions
 - Static typing
 - No header files. No forward declarations.
 - The point of C ABI compatibility is interoperability. It is necessary, but not sufficient, to be able to 
   consume C libraries in n9 code. It is also required to be able to consume n9 libraries from C code, and by
   extension, from C++, D, rust, go, nim, C#, java, python, etc.
 - This has to really work. In theory you can make shared libraries in D and consume them in C, but in practice
   this is a really bad idea.

Additional principals of the project:
 
 - n9's primary use case is the creation of high-performance libraries that can be consumed by higher level languages.
 - It is also just fine for creating entire programs in, as long as "writing said entire program in C" is a good idea.
 - n9 aims to be useful, whether or not anyone uses it or not. 
   It is not an academic project, it's here to solve a problem.
 - Performance is absolutely critical. As a result it must produce fast programs today, with no
   performance loss vs writing in C. Theoretical performance is uninteresting.
 - In its current form, it accomplishes both "high performance" and "C ABI compabitility" by
   compiling to C code and then invoking established C compilers. This "compile to C" is NOT 
   an intrinsic part of the language, though it is quite likely that this will remain in place for
   some time, as LLVM integration is not in any way straighforward.
 - While this is the case, multiple C compiler targets should be supported. GCC, clang, visual C++ (2013), and TCC.
   TCC would be embedded for cases where no other C compiler is available on the host platform; additionally it 
   might be used for "fast build speed" modes.
 - Although C ABI compatiblity and consuming n9 libraries from other languages is a goal, some concessions are 
   made. For example, namespacing is absolutely required, therefore name mangling will be utilized, with options for 
   exported symbols.
 - This project shares many goals with Jonathan Blow's "jai" game programming language. It is too early to say how
   JAI will turn out. Our priorities may be different than his. If his language evolves faster and meets our goals,
   then we should adopt his language or merge useful ideas into it (if possible). Consider this a backup implementation,
   this niche is too important to go unserved.
 - This C# compiler is a prototype compiler. Eventually, we would rewrite the compiler in n9. 
   This is not because bootstrapping is cool. We WOULD write the compiler in C, because C is fast and runs everywhere.
   But I hate writing C code, _thats the whole point of this project_. 
   We want to run on (basically) all platforms that C runs on, Windows/Linux/Mac (in that order).
 - Rust-style safety is not a priority to us. C would be close to fine with us, if it was more modernized. C will never
   reach this goal until it sheds backward compatibility.
 - Unlike java, d, or rust, how you divide your code into different source files should not matter.
 - We do "project-level" compilation, not partial compilation. There are real pros and cons to partial compilation.
   There are ways to make project-level compilation fast enough, I think. 
   In .NET terminology, we would compile at the Assembly level.
 - Interfaces are good... Potentially via fat pointers; we would prefer not to have to modify your structs other than padding.
 - Type inference for sure.
 - Multiple return values via autogen struct.
 - C# style implicit/explicit type conversion?
 - Getters/Setters properties ala C#?
 - Defer statement for sure
 - Some kind of foreach... but not sure about fancy iterators
 - Optional/default/named parameters
 - Tracking of nullability/non-nullability?
 - Probably operator overloading
 - Rusts "loop" keyword is probably a good thing. I have a LOT of while(true) in this compiler.
   Maybe that's just my failure to construct more clever loops but whatever. Its how I write code.
 - Very much want to incorporate unlikely branch / cold code path into the language definition.
 - Writing this compiler in C#, I have very frequently wanted to use Ceylon's flow-dependent typing.
   However I do not believe this feature would be applicable to n9 as I don't think it will have a traditional inheritance model.

 - Note to self, Andrei's Expected<T> talk is interesting.
TODO: It would be cool if there were full separation and interjectable places between:
 - Lexer
 - Parser
 - Binder
 - Analytical phases, lowering, etc
 - Code generation

At the moment these are semi-isolated but not necessarily 100%. Logically we're in good shape, API-wise some changes may be required.
Syntax quibble: the "name:type" syntax preclude the use of : for "goto_label:". Decide how to resolve. Not 100% married to the name:type syntax but it seems to be in vogue.
